/**
 * App registry — the single source of truth for the landing grid.
 *
 * Each mini app is an independent Cloudflare Worker, deployed from its own repo,
 * bound to the route patterns `<domain>/<slug>` and `<domain>/<slug>/*`. Cloudflare
 * resolves the most-specific route first, so a child Worker automatically overrides
 * this host's catch-all for its own paths.
 *
 * To add a mini app to the grid:
 *   1. Deploy the child app Worker with routes for its slug (see docs/hosting-a-mini-app.md).
 *   2. Add an entry below and redeploy the host.
 *
 * `path` MUST be `/<slug>` (a real cross-document link, not client-side routing).
